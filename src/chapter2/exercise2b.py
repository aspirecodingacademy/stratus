Let's practice working with numbers - integers and floats!

Integers are whole numbers, and floats are decimal numbers

# Print happens to take care of not only strings but also numbers, how convenient!
temperature = 75
print(temperature)

# Make two variables. One called high_temp, another low_temp. Set them to integers of your choice. Then print the difference between the two.

# Use the two variables and print their sum, difference, product, and division results to see how Python handles math operations with ints.

# Make a two variable called wind_mph, rainfall_inches and give them float values

# Use the two variables and print their sum, difference, product, and division results to see how Python handles math operations with floats.
